# mathViz
A collection of math visualizations.... Well actually just three math visualizations for now... ~~Technically not even one, I just made a repository in Hope of eventually making some math visualization when I get around to it...~~ Surprisingly enough, i did already make something, mainly experimenting around and trying to get used to python though
